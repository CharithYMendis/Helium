implementation

old bbinfo, moduleinfo files -> bbinfo_global, bbinfo_global_container
new profilers -> bbinfo_thread, bbinfo_thread_container

have the old global + module->bbs(with function information) as well.
change the composition module->function(approx)->bbs
per thread module_t * and record the bb information per thread


old format
bb_addr,freq,function,size,sizeof(from_bbs),from_bbs,freq,sizeof(callers),call_addresses,freq


old_filter_format
<number_of_modules>
<module_name>
<number_of_basic_blocks>
<bb_addr> -> depending on what you are filtering this can be interpreted as a bb address or a function entry point or a range of addresses
..
..


newly proposed format for output
<number_of_modules>
<module_name>
<number_of_functions>
<function_target>
<number_of_basic_blocks>
<bb_information> -> bb_addr,size,freq,sizeof(from_bbs),from_bbs,freq,sizeof(callers),call_addresses,freq
..
..
..



newly proposed filter format
actually the filter file should contain the filtering method
<filter_method>
then the same as the old filter file format
