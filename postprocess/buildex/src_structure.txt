Memory

abstract files - classes
memregions - abstract memory regions with structures, buffer shapes (like dimensions, extent etc.)
meminfo - concrete memory regions

specialized files
memdump - deals with extracting memory dump information
memanalysis - does the actual memory analysis using the structures from above files

halide

halide - defines the halide class and its methods -> represents a Halide program
(given a symbolic tree, the Halide program should be generated)


trees

These define all classes for the trees
nodes
trees


analysis - all the preprocessing and mutating routines of data strucutures - vector of something

staticinfo

preprocess -> all the mutating preprocessing passes in this file
expression_extraction -> backward analysis
conditional_analysis -> forward analysis
tree_analysis -> go get information from the trees
static_analysis
